# YesOS
Simple OS with 0 functionality, all it can do now is nothing :|

## Planned Features
1. Print to screen
2. Interactive shell
3. Snek Game
4. File System (Maybe?)
5. Read/Write files?

## Bugs
1. Print string breaks after 7 characters.
2. Print string's argument must be initialised as a char array first, before being passed in.
