# YesOS
Simple OS with 0 functionality, all it can do now is nothing :|

(Moved [here](https://github.com/wHo69/SimpleOS) cuz printing doesn't work)
(apparently is cuz I compiled in 64 bit and ran in 32 bit :\)

## Bugs
1. Print string breaks after 7 characters.
2. Print string's argument must be initialised as a char array first, before being passed in.
